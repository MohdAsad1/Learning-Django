Django REST Framework (DRF) :- 
A powerful toolkit and the de facto standard for building RESTful APIs with the Django web framework. 
It seamlessly integrates with Django's core features to convert complex data like Django models into formats like JSON or XML 
that can be used by modern frontends, mobile apps, or other services. 

[Core Concepts]
DRF development revolves around several key components:

1 - Serializers: These act like Django Forms but for API data. 
They are responsible for converting complex data types (like Django model instances and querysets) into native Python datatypes 
that can be easily rendered into JSON or other content types. 
Serializers also handle incoming data deserialization and validation.

2 -Views and ViewSets: Views handle the incoming HTTP requests and return the HTTP responses, but unlike traditional Django views that render HTML templates, DRF views 
 return data (usually JSON).
A - APIView is the basic class that extends Django's View class, providing functionality for handling authentication and permissions.
B- GenericAPIView and its subclasses (e.g., ListCreateAPIView) provide ready-made solutions for common use cases like listing and creating objects.
C - ViewSet abstracts logic even further by combining related views for standard CRUD operations (list, create, retrieve, update, destroy) 
into a single class, minimizing code repetition.

3 - Routers: When using ViewSet classes, DRF routers (DefaultRouter or SimpleRouter) automatically generate standardized URL patterns for the various actions, 
eliminating the need to manually define each URL path.

4 - Authentication and Permissions: DRF provides a flexible, built-in system to secure your API.
A - Authentication identifies the user making the request (e.g., using sessions, tokens, or OAuth).
B - Permissions determine if the identified user has the necessary access to perform the requested action (e.g., only allowing an object's owner to delete it).

5 - Browsable API: A major usability feature of DRF is the interactive, web-browsable API interface. 
It allows developers to interact with the API endpoints directly in a web browser, making testing and debugging significantly easier.

Basic Development Flow of a DRF Project

1 - Install Django and Django REST Framework using pip install djangorestframework.
2 - Add 'rest_framework' and your app to the INSTALLED_APPS in your Django project's settings.py file.
3 - Define your data models in models.py and run migrations.
4 - Create a serializers.py file in your app to define how model instances are converted to JSON and back.
5 - Define a ViewSet in views.py to handle API requests and link it to your serializer.
6 - Configure URL routing, typically using a router.register() call in your project's urls.py file to automatically map the ViewSet actions to URL endpoints.
